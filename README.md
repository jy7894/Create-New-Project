to use this use
- python3 main.py {ProjectName} {LangaugePrefix} {ProjectPath}

this creates a project file with a main file and a run script (also makes a venv for python)

currently this only supports:
- Python
- Java
- c++

currently this uses python3 and uses bash for run sripts (will add powershell soon)
